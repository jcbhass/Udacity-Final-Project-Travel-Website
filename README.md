# Travel App Udacity Final Project 

## Overview
This project required an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. Once the user enters a city within the United States and desired travel start and end dates, they receive:
-  a picture of the city they would like to travel to (or picture the American flag if the city does not have PixaBay image hits)
-  the trip length 
-  the local weather at the start of the trip
-  an animated Skycon of the weather 

## Instructions
Please use "npm run start-prod" to start the application. The localhost is 5000.
